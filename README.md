# wanna leran something
this is for my learning front-end something's repository.  
## Why did I make it?
I've been needing my task of programming which is mostly front-end visually. I can make it by using such as evernote or just memo app's, but I wanted to do it by open.  
I don't know this is whether good for them who are front-end developer or not but I actually wanted to do it for me and for my future as a front-end developer.  
Additionally, I usually use React.js while working in the company. but I've been thinking wanna learn bunch of other frameworks such as angular, vue.js and even react-state manager which are MobX, Redux and so on, I wanna learn and stacking experience more deeply.
